# Palettte Swapping in GameMaker

Are you a fan of computer graphics from the olden days of video games, before artists had the full gamut of 16,777,215 colors to play with and were instead constrained to palettes of up to 256 colors to choose from? Do you wish you could achieve fancy artistic effects by simply replacing colors in the palette of a single sprite? Do you wish this effect could be performed blazingly fast, and easy to combine into other shaders to boot? You're going to enjoy this!

## Supported Platforms

I've tested it on Windows, Linux (including the Raspberry Pi), OperaGX, and HTML5, and they work correctly on each of those platforms. By all accounts it should work on pretty much every other platform, including consoles, but I haven't tested it.

## Can I use ____ from this project?

The extension itself, obviously yes. Get the "official" release from the Itch page.

Code from the demo, I guess you can use it if you really want to, but most of it was written in a hurry and won't do much for you in a "real" game.

Audio and graphics are a definitive "no." They're not mine, and I can't give you permission to use them. I've left the sources for them down below.
